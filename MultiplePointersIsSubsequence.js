// Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two srings
// and checks whether the characters in the first string for a subsequence
// of the characters in the 2nd string. 
// In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the
// 1st string appear somewhere in the 2nd string, without their order changing

// MUST have AT LEAST the following complexities:
// Time: O(n + m)
// Space: O(1)

// 

function isSubsequence() {
  // good luck. Add any arguments you deem necessary.
